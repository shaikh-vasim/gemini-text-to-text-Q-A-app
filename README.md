Welcome to the Gemini LLM (Language Model) Application, a Streamlit-based Q&A demo powered by Google's Generative AI.

## Overview

This application utilizes the Gemini Pro model from Google's Generative AI to generate responses based on user-input questions. It serves as a demonstration of the capabilities of the Gemini Pro model for natural language understanding and generation.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Before running the application, make sure you have the following:

- Python installed on your machine.
- Install the required Python packages using the following command:

  ```bash
  pip install -r requirements.txt
  ```

### Configuration

1. Obtain a Google API key 
2. Create a `.env` file in the project directory and add your API key:

   ```
   GOOGLE_API_KEY=your_google_api_key_here
   ```

### Running the Application

Run the Streamlit application using the following command:

```bash
streamlit run app.py
```

Replace `app.py` with the name of your Python script containing the provided code.

## Usage

1. Enter your question in the input field.
2. Click the "Ask the Question" button.
3. The application will generate and display the response from the Gemini Pro model.

## About the Code

The code uses the Streamlit framework for the user interface and the Google Generative AI library to interact with the Gemini Pro model. The `get_gemini_response` function is responsible for sending questions to the model and retrieving the generated responses.
